<br>
I am a student in the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington.  

My research interests are deeply influenced by the boom and bust (downturn) of real estate markets in China and their implications for macro economy and micro behaviors. Therefore, I aim to develop the behavioral foundations of related social phenomena to better inform urban planning and development. In the coming years, my research will focus on urban economics, real estate and housing markets.  

Prior to UW, I got my MUP and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University, where I tackled location choice and location allocation through game theory and operations research for the spatial matching of public service and population. 
 
My academic journey includes several research experiences, as well as presentations at international conferences. **Please feel free to reach out if we have shared interests!**

I enjoy photography, a skill I honed as a member (and later the leader) of the Zhejiang University Radio and Television Station Photography Department. Check out my [photos](https://hlpgallery.mysxl.cn/)! I also like pool and city walks. Since I came to US, somehow I enjoy cooking:)
