I am a student in the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. [Arthur Acolin](https://re.be.uw.edu/people/arthur-acolin/) and co-advised by Prof. [Qing Shen](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/).  

My research interests are deeply influenced by the boom and downturn of real estate market in China and the outcomes for macro economy and micro behaviors. Therefore, my research investigates the roles of the three agents and the interactions across the three (sub)markets. By unraveling the empirical evidence and establishing the behavioral foundations of related social phenomena, I seek to provide insights that better inform urban planning and development.  

Prior to UW, I got my MUP and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University. Advised by Prof. [Guoqiang Shen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shen), I tackled location choice and location allocation through game theory and operations research for the spatial matching of public service and population.
