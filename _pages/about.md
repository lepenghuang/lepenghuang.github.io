<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at University of Washington.  

My research interests are deeply influenced by the boom and bust of Chinaâ€™s real estate markets and their implications for urban planning and development. Therefore, I aim to develop the behavioral foundations of these social phenomena to provide deeper insights for planning and policy decisions. In the coming years, my research will focus on urban economics, financial analysis, real estate and housing markets.  

Prior to UW, I got my MUP and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University, where I studied location choice and location allocation through game theory and operations research.  
 
My academic journey includes several research experiences, as well as presentations at international conferences. **Please feel free to reach out if we have shared interests!**
