<br>
I am a student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at University of Washington.  

My research interests are deeply influenced by the dramatic downturn in Chinaâ€™s real estate markets and urban planning industry. Therefore, I aim to develop the behavioral foundations of related social phenomena to better inform urban planning and development. In the coming years, my research will focus on urban economics, financial analysis, real estate and housing markets.  

Prior to UW, I got my MUP and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University, where I studied location choice and location allocation through game theory and operations research.  
 
My academic journey includes several research experiences, as well as presentations at international conferences. **Please contact me if we have shared interests!**
