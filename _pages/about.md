<br>
I am going to be a PhD student in Interdisciplinary Program in Urban Design and Planning at University of Washington in September 2025.  

My research interests are deeply influenced by the dramatic downturn in Chinaâ€™s real estate markets and urban planning industry. Therefore, I aim to develop the behavioral foundations of related social phenomena to better inform urban planning and development. In the coming years, my research will focus on urban economics, financial analysis, real estate and housing markets.  

Prior to UW, I got my Master of Urban Planning and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University, where I studied location allocation and location choice through operations research and game theory.  
 
My academic journey includes several independent research projects and presentations at international conferences. Please contact me if you are interested in me!
