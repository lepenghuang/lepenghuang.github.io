Education
======
* Ph.D in Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Urban Design and Planning, University of Wahsington, 2029 (expected)
  * Advisor: Prof. Arthur Acolin.
  * Co-Advisor: Prof. Qing Shen.
* Master of Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, 2025
  * Advisor: Prof. Guoqiang Shen.
* B.Eng. in Urban and Rural Planning, Zhejiang University, 2023
  * Recommended for graduate admission without entrance examination with 1st in overall ranking.

Research Experience
======
* National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, China,	Spring 2020–Spring 2021
  * Participant, Professor Qiuxiao Chen’s group
  * Developed a resilience-oriented index to assess the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities. Applied AHP-CRITIC and matter-element analysis      methods to calculate index weights. Conducted empirical research in Hangzhou, China.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, Summer 2022
  * Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
  * Became the first group to apply the Nobel Prize-winning Gale-Shapley algorithm to investigate the spatial matching of urban healthcare facilities and population.
  * Compared the performance of the Gale-Shapley approach and the traditional accessibility approach. Demonstrated that the Gale-Shapley approach is superior in consideration of human preferences.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, Winter 2022–Summer 2023
  * Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
  * Developed a stable spatial matching method based on the Nobel Prize-winning two-sided matching to address the issue of population bypass the closest low-level facilities in favor of higher-level ones.
  * Constructed a utility function from key factors such as facility location, level, price, and the trade-offs of human preferences. Summarized the regularities in the model behavior.
  * Designed heterogeneous utility function weights of human preferences because no empirical data could be found for regression. Analyzed different matching scenarios and found those fixed pairs.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, Winter 2023–April 2025
  * Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
  * Regressed the parameters of the population’s utility function using the micro-social-economic data of Chinese residents from the CHARLS dataset.
  * Developed methodologies using operations research for top-down systemic planning and game-theoretic equilibrium for bottom-up individual choice.
  * Revealed significant findings for urban planning, including the reasons behind patients bypassing the closest low-level facilities, the consistency of the trade-offs across various matching approaches and the comparative advantages of systemic planning and individual choice.
* School of Geographical Sciences, East China Normal University, Spring 2024–Feburary 2025
  * Participant, Professor Yu Zhou and Prof. Guoqiang Shen’s group	
  * Assisted in validating a well-known statistical pattern using a global disaster dataset and described the performance across the scales of time and space.
  * Explained the cause of the pattern based on the nature of disasters as their stochastic processes and memoryless properties. Designated indexes to conduct absolute and relative risk analysis.

Professional Experience
======
* International Competitions, Overall Urban Design and Downtown Detailed Urban Design of Dongyang City, 2023
* Urban Planning and Design, Science and Technology City of Zhuji City, 2022
