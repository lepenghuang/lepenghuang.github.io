Education
======
* Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning, University of Wahsington, *June 2029 (Expected)*
  * Advisor: Prof. Arthur Acolin.
  * Co-Advisor: Prof. Qing Shen.
* Master of Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, *June 2025 (Early Graduation)*
  * Advisor: Prof. Guoqiang Shen.
* B.Eng. in Urban and Rural Planning, Zhejiang University, *June 2023 (Outstanding Graduate)*
  * Recommended for graduate admission without entrance examination with 1st in overall ranking.

Research Interests
======
* Urban economics.
* Real estate and housing markets.
* Spatial matching of public service and population:
  * Location choice, employing game theory.
  * Location allocation, employing operations research.
* Win-win strategies in (sustainable) urban planning and development.

Research Experience
======
* Department of Urban Design and Planning/Runstad Department of Real Estate, University of Washington, *Summer 2025 - Present*
  * Independent Study, Advised by Prof. Arthur Acolin.
  * Analyzing the distinct but interconnected real estate markets in China.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, *Winter 2023 – Spring 2025*
  * Independent Study, Advised by Prof. Guoqiang Shen.	
  * Regressed the parameters of the population’s utility function using the micro-social-economic data of Chinese residents from the CHARLS dataset.
  * Developed methodologies using operations research for top-down systemic planning and game-theoretic equilibrium for bottom-up individual choice.
  * Revealed significant findings for urban planning, including the reasons behind patients bypassing the closest low-level facilities, the consistency of the trade-offs across various matching approaches and the comparative advantages of systemic planning and individual choice.
* School of Geographical Sciences, East China Normal University, *Spring 2024 – Spring 2025*
  * Participant, Advised by Prof. Yu Zhou and Prof. Guoqiang Shen.	
  * Assisted in validating a well-known statistical pattern using a global disaster dataset and described the performance across the scales of time and space.
  * Explained the cause of the pattern based on the nature of disasters as their stochastic processes and memoryless properties. Designated indexes to conduct absolute and relative risk analysis.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, *Winter 2022 – Summer 2023*
  * Independent Study, Advised by Prof. Guoqiang Shen.	
  * Developed a stable spatial matching method based on the Nobel Prize-winning two-sided matching to address the issue of population bypass the closest low-level facilities in favor of higher-level ones.
  * Constructed a utility function from key factors such as facility location, level, price, and the trade-offs of human preferences. Summarized the regularities in the model behavior.
  * Designed heterogeneous utility function weights of human preferences because no empirical data could be found for regression. Analyzed different matching scenarios and found those fixed pairs.
* Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, *Summer 2022*
  * Independent Study, Advised by Prof. Guoqiang Shen.
  * Became the first group to apply the Nobel Prize-winning Gale-Shapley algorithm to investigate the spatial matching of urban healthcare facilities and population.
  * Compared the performance of the Gale-Shapley approach and the traditional accessibility approach. Demonstrated that the Gale-Shapley approach is superior in consideration of human preferences.
* National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, China,	*Spring 2020–Spring 2021*
  * Participant, Prof. Qiuxiao Chen’s Group.
  * Developed a resilience-oriented index to assess the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities. Applied AHP-CRITIC and matter-element analysis methods to calculate index weights. Conducted empirical research in Hangzhou, China.
